\section{Related Work}

In robotics, external environment sensing is an important problem that many robots must deal with. Many robots use LiDAR, but find that it generates a lot of data and takes too long to compute. Many others have shown very promising results using online stereo vision for terrain mapping when \cite{5152795,DBLP:conf/humanoids/FallonMDWAMT15}. As a future step, the stereo reconstruction may also be used as ground truth data to give the robot an accurate global positioning.

There are many stereo vision algorithms that are currently being used as described in \cite{journals/js/HamzahI16}. This provides a wide survey of different techniques used for reconstruction of 3D information from stereo cameras. These methods outlined, as well as the successful results in robotics expressed the validity of using stereo reconstruction for terrain mapping during dynamic locomotion.
