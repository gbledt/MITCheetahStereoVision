%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
   Our goal in this project is to create an inexpensive, lightweight and robust vision system that can estimate the terrain in front of the MIT Cheetah 3 robot in real time. Using a stereo rig consisting of two \$20 webcams, we are able to obtain metrically accurate 3D reconstructions of planar obstacles from image pairs. In addition, by fitting a polytope to noisy terrain point clouds, our representation of the terrain is robust to outliers and has a very compact parametrization.
